# SQL Generator
### Overview
The SQL Generator is a powerful tool based on OpenAI's Large Language Model (LLM) that simplifies the process of generating SQL queries for databases. Whether you're working with SQLite3, MySQL, or PostgreSQL, this project allows users to input queries in plain language and automatically generates the corresponding SQL code.

### Features
* User-Friendly Interface: The SQL Generator is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to input queries using everyday language.

* Multi-Database Support: It supports multiple database management systems, including SQLite3, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, making it versatile for various data storage solutions.

* Automatic Query Conversion: Users can simply describe the data they want or the actions they need to perform, and the SQL Generator translates this into SQL code.

* No Prior SQL Knowledge Required: The tool is perfect for users who may not be SQL experts but need to interact with databases.

* SQL Query Examples: The SQL Generator offers a selection of query examples for common tasks, serving as a helpful reference.

### Getting Started
1. Installation: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can typically install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Usage: Run the application and start inputting your queries in natural language. The SQL Generator will automatically convert them into SQL.

3. Database Configuration: Make sure to configure the tool for your specific database system. You will need to provide connection details and credentials.

4. Example Queries: If you're not sure how to phrase your query in natural language, refer to the example queries provided in the tool for guidance.

### Configuration
To configure the SQL Generator for a specific database system, you'll need to provide:

* Database Type: Choose the database management system you are using (SQLite3, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).

* Connection Details: Input the database host, port, username, and password to establish a connection.
